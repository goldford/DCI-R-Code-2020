# DCI R Code (2020 - 2023)
For R version 3.6.1
Last updated: July 2023 by Greig Oldford

This repo contains scripts to calculate the Dendritic Connectivity Index (DCI) allowing for the analysis of ecological longitudinal connectivity of river networks.

The codebase was completely revised in 2020 but this repo is no longer recommended except for those looking to integrate DCI calculations within ArcGIS ArcMap using the FIPEX 'Add In'. An R package, [dci](https://github.com/aarkilanian/dci), is now under development. 

To use this code to integrate with the FIPEX ArcMap toolset, use the code found in the '2020' folder. Code in other folders is experimental.
