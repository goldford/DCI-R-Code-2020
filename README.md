# DCI R Code 2020
 R version 3.6.1

This repo contains scripts to calculate the Dendritic Connectivity Index (DCI) allowing for the analysis of ecological longitudinal connectivity of river networks. 

This repo is no longer recommended except for those looking to integrate DCI calculations within ArcGIS ArcMap using the FIPEX 'Add In'. An R package, [dci](https://github.com/aarkilanian/dci), is now under development.
